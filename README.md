# Livekit

A WIP library to provide unstyled, accessible UI components for Phoenix LiveView applications.

#### Modal

- [ ] `.modal_title` sub-component
- [ ] ARIA attributes
    - [ ] Need to generate IDs somehow
- [ ] Stop body from scrolling (or is this a styling concern?)
- [ ] History modal example does not work
- [ ] Form component issue

#### Dropdown


- [ ] Need to generate IDs somehow
  - [ ] Click away currently uses hardcoded ID
  - [ ] Probably means multiple on the same page will not work
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Tabindex
- [ ] Tab + Enter should open
- [ ] Should dropdown close when item is clicked?
- [ ] Render dropdown item `as` a link, button or whatever you want
