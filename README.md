Prima is a Phoenix LiveView component library providing unstyled, accessible UI components. It's designed as a reusable library that developers can integrate into Phoenix applications and style according to their needs.

## Installation

Add `prima` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:prima, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Quick Start

1. Add Prima to your dependencies and run `mix deps.get`

2. Import Prima components in your Phoenix application:

```elixir
# In your application's components or live views
import Prima.Modal
import Prima.Dropdown
import Prima.Combobox
```

3. Include Prima's JavaScript hooks in your application:

```javascript
// assets/js/app.js
import { PrimaHooks } from "prima"

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
  hooks: { ...PrimaHooks },
  // ... other options
})
```

4. Use components in your templates:

```heex
<.modal id="my-modal">
  <:title>Modal Title</:title>
  <p>Modal content goes here</p>
</.modal>

<.dropdown id="my-dropdown">
  <:trigger>
    <button>Open Menu</button>
  </:trigger>
  <:item>Option 1</:item>
  <:item>Option 2</:item>
</.dropdown>
```

## Development

### Setup

```bash
mix setup                # Full setup (deps, assets setup, assets build)
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
mix phx.server          # Start development server
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000/demo` to see all components in action.

### Testing

```

The test suite includes both unit tests and comprehensive browser-based integration tests using Wallaby to ensure all interactive behaviors work correctly.
