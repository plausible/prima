Prima is a Phoenix LiveView component library providing unstyled, accessible UI components. It's designed as a reusable library that developers can integrate into Phoenix applications and style according to their needs.

## Installation

Add `prima` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:prima, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Include Prima's JavaScript hooks in your application:

```javascript
// assets/js/app.js
import { PrimaHooks } from "prima"

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
  hooks: { ...PrimaHooks },
  // ... other options
})
```

Use components in your templates:

```heex
<Prima.Dropdown.dropdown id="demo-dropdown">
  <Prima.Dropdown.dropdown_trigger>
    Open Dropdown
  </Prima.Dropdown.dropdown_trigger>

  <Prima.Dropdown.dropdown_menu>
    <Prima.Dropdown.dropdown_item>Item 1</.dropdown_item>
    <Prima.Dropdown.dropdown_item>Item 2</.dropdown_item>
  </Prima.Dropdown.dropdown_menu>
</Prima.Dropdown.dropdown>
